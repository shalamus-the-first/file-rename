# File Rename

Renames all files in the same directory from where the java code was initated from. Renames the file properly by removing all uppercase letters and symbols. To run the code is very straight forward


## Step 1

run ```javac *.java```


## Step 2

run ```java FileManagement```


Done !!!


You must copy files into the same Directory where you've compiled my code in order for it to work.
